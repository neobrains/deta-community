# Getting Started with Projects

## Creating a Project
By default your account has one project named `default`. You can create as many new projects as you like to organize and group your Micros, Bases, and Drives.
To create a new project, go to the [Deta Dashboard](https://web.deta.sh/) and create a new project by clicking on the `+ New Project` button in dropdown menu.
