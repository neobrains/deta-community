### Issues with `deta login`
!!! help ""
    Most likely the issue is caused by your browser or an extension blocking scripts.
    Disable any extensions on the login page, or if you are using Brave, disable Brave Shields. Otherwise, try a different browser.
    If that doesn't work either, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/auth#deta-access-tokens) to log in with an access token.
