# Getting Help

## **Before you ask**
Before you ask for help, please read the following:

If your question is related to accounts or the platform in general, please email <a href="mailto:team@deta.sh">team@deta.sh</a>.
Otherwise,

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered in [discord help channel](https://go.deta.dev/discord) / [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/deta/discussions) / [here](/faq) and you have read the [official documentation](https://docs.deta.sh). If it has been answered but does not satisfy you, you can just comment in that form. Moreover adequately research before asking.

- Use a succinct title and description of the issue/bug/report.

- Write the current output and expected output with steps to produce it. Also tell us if it's working fine offline or not

- Write down the name of your OS with python/node version.

- At the end , write paste the logs (deta logs / console logs ) and code with any images if required.
